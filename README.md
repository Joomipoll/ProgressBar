- `bgclr` - sets the mother block color of the progress bar (for example `black`)
- `bgstart` - sets the initial color of the loading bar (for example `blue`)
- `bgfinish` - sets the end color of the loading bar (for example `white`)
- `duration` - sets the run time of the loading bar (for example `10s`)
- `percent` - sets the loading bar percentage (for example `50%`)

Syntax: `https://example.com/index.html?<attribute1>=<value1>&<attribute2>=<value2>` <br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
